# Garbage
Farkle mixed with yahtzee where you may get something you think is good, but its actual garbage.

Rules:
On the first turn you roll all 6 dice.
You must get a One, Five or any Combination listed.
If you roll all 6 into One, Five or some of the many Combinations you have Hot Dice and can start over rolling all 6.
You will then add the total from before Hot Dice to the new roll. You can roll until you want to stop unless you
do not roll a One, Five or a Combination. You can then choose to take a Chance or take a 0. If you take a Chance and fail you will be
deducted 500 points. If you succeeded then you continue until you choose to stop or fail and take another Chance or take a 0.
If you fail another Chance you are deducted 500 points multiplied by the amount of successful Chances.

Combinations:
Five - 50 Points
1 Pair Any Number - 50 Points
One - 100 Points
3 x Twos - 200 Points
Straight One-Two-Three - 250 Points

Special Rules:
Chances - Chances allow you to continue when you've rolled nothing. If you successfully roll a One, Five or Combination you continue 
and add the result to your total. Each chance you take multiples the amount of points lost if the next chance is unsuccessful. Use them
wisely.

Hot Dice - When you roll all 6 into a One, Five or Combination you can pickup all 6 and roll them again. You now add the total from the last
roll to the new roll and continue on until you get Hot Dice again, take a chance or take a 0.

Adds - Each game you are alloted 2 adds. This allows you to create a combination from individually rolled dice. For example, if you roll 
6 Ones in 6 different turns you can use an add to make it a combination of 6 Set Any Number and claim 3000 points instead of 600. After 
using an add you must end your turn and take the total you rolled. You may use 1 add from the beginning and the second after the halfway
mark of the game. You cannot use both in the same quarter.
